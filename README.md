## Description:
This project involves taking photos with a Raspberry Pi Camera on The International Space Station (ISS) and using these images to estimate the speed of the observed changes. The Code provided here has been tested on the ISS and utilizes image processing techniques to analyze the captured images. When the code was tested on the ISS we got the result 7.47 km/s, which is close to the correct speed which is 7.66 km/s.

# Mission Space Lab from the ESA and Raspberry PiCompany
Solve a scientific task in space

In Mission Space Lab teams are invited to write computer programs that solve a scientific task in space: to gather data to calculate the speed at which the International Space Station (ISS) is travelling as accurately as possible.

To achieve this, teams write a Python program to first use the Astro Pi computersâ€™ sensors or camera and gather data about the orientation and motion of the ISS as it orbits the Earth, and then calculate the speed of the ISS based on the gathered data.

Taking part in Astro Pi Mission Space Lab enables young people to learn about the ISS, about gathering and using data to answer a scientific question, and about creating and troubleshooting a computer program. They also have the exciting opportunity to learn about the science of motion and the orbit of the ISS. Eligible programs will be deployed on the ISS, and teams will receive certificates and data collected in space.
